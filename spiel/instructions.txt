1) First of all, please make sure that you have atleast the following files..

1 x .html file
1 x .swf or .dcr file
4 x .gif/.jpg files used to advertise the game
(Other files may include level data for certain games)


2) Make a new folder on your website and call it the name of the game (or simply use the entire folder which these instructions text file is contained within).

i) if you have decided to create a folder place both the .html file and .swf or .dcr files into this folder 
ii) go to www.YourWebsite.com/game-folder/the-name-of-the-game.htm to test the game
iii) change the look of the html page so it matches your website

Note: the html file contains the important Object tag.  The .swf or .dcr file is the important game file.  The images are just for linking/describing the game
